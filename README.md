Ride-share data analysis

## Overview
Analyze ride-share data to show the relationship between the type of city and how it correlates with number of drivers, number of riders and their fares. Data will help improve access to ride-share services and improve affordability in underserved neighborhoods.

### Results

* There are far fewer rides in rural cities, to the tune of 5 times fewer than that of urban cities and 13 times fewer than suburban cities.  
* This corresponds with drivers as well with 6 times fewer drivers in rural areas versus urban cities and 30 times fewer than suburban cities. 
* The average fare per ride in rural cities is about $35 which costs about $4 more per ride than in suburban areas and $10 more than urban cities.
* The average fare per driver in rural cities is about $55 compared to $40 in suburban cities and $17 in urban cities.

As you can see in the following graph, the total fares by city type show that rural drivers are making far less than drivers in suburban and urban areas. They make 4 times less than suburban drivers in total fares and 8 times less than urban drivers.

#### Summary
Based on these results, I would recommend the following:
1. Recruit more drivers for coverage in rural areas.
2. Focus on advertising the availability of rise-share options in rural communities to increase overall volume.
3. Because rural drivers likely cover more miles for each trip, find efficiencies in getting from point A to point B to help cut costs per ride.
